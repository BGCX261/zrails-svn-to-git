|| *Type* || Description || 
|| All || Returns every page. This is useful for dropdown menu pagination controls with  relatively few pages. In these cases, you want all pages available to the user at once. ||
|| Elastic || A Google-like scrolling style that expands and contracts as a user scrolls through the pages.||
|| Jumping || As users scroll through, the page number advances to the end of a given range, then starts again at the beginning of the new range. ||
|| Sliding || A Yahoo!-like scrolling style that positions the current page number in the center of the page range, or as close as possible. This is the default style. ||

$view_script - view script to show paginator see example [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.paginator.usage.html zend.paginator.usage.html]
